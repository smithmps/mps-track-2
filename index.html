<!--script link only works when script is linked at the end of body tag. It'll work in a separate file if you put the script tag including the file at the end of the body, just before the closing </body> tag. The reason it isn't working is that when it's in the head, the code runs right away, and the elements don't exist yet, so the handler doesn't get hooked up. The right answer here is to put the script tag for the code right at the end.-->
